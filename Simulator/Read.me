This software was created as part of the development process as a proving ground for the PUTSI firmware. It contains the same code as the microcontroller, 
but instead of the ‘real’ ports, it uses Windows dialog boxes and screen updates instead. We hope that it will be useful in debugging Allstar applications, and to exercise the functions of the telemetry module. 

It is an unsupported product, however those modules common to the production code will be kept in sync as time goes on.
