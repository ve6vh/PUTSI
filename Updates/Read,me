Firmware update from v1.0 to 1.1
A bug was found in the pin status processing routine that did not update the monitor status correctly. Pin 9 had a default setting so it always worked.
A second bug was found in the integer to ascii routine, which was dropping a trailing zero. This could have created incorrect voltage readings when values ended in zero, and it also
appears that this bug occurs with number that have a zero in the middle, like 201, 202, etc. So a fix is still pending.

This bug has finally been fixed..now onto the remote reset again!!

I have also uploaded a version called 'no poll timeout'. This reinstates the remote reset feature. Once the connection with asterisk is started, the no poll timer is enabled and set to 30 seconds.
If no poll is received in that time, the board will reset enabling you to restart asterisk. Polls should occur once every 10 seconds, on each poll the timer is restarted.
