Firmware update from v1.0 to 1.1
A bug was found in the pin status processing routine that did not update the monitor status correctly. Pin 9 had a default setting so it always worked.
A second bug was found in the integer to ascii routine, which was dropping a trailing zero. This could have created incorrect voltage readings when values ended in zero.

This update is mandatory.
