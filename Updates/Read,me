Firmware update from v1.0 to 1.1
A bug was found in the pin status processing routine that did not update the monitor status correctly. Pin 9 had a default setting so it always worked.
A second bug was found in the integer to ascii routine, which was dropping a trailing zero. This could have created incorrect voltage readings when values ended in zero, and it also
appears that this bug occurs with number that have a zero in the middle, like 201, 202, etc. So a fix is still pending.

This bug has finally been fixed..now onto the remote reset again!!

Hex file is in this directory.
