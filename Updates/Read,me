Firmware update to V1.2
The following are from the release notes in the Rev 1.2 documenation:

1.	Bugs Fixed
A bug still remained in the ascii conversion routine. Trailing zeros were correct, but number such as 203 would be emitted as 23. This was re-written.

2.	Changes to Alarm monitoring
The default alarm status for pin 9 was removed, to enable Allstar to configure the monitor mode. It appears that in older versions of asterisk this command is not implemented, so all the inputs are 
initialized in monitor mode. For versions after V1.4.23, the correct status will be updated.

3.	USB mode LED activation
In previous versions the USB mode was activated by a command from Allstar to turn the LED on. This has been revised to turn it on when the first poll command is received. It is n ow consistent with the WiFi m
ode that is activated after a connection has been made.

4.	No Poll timeout
A 30 second no poll timeout has been added. Allstar should poll once every 10 seconds if no poll has been received in that time the device resets.

5.	Startup Mode
In previous versions the device would enter the configuration mode if the EEPROM configuration was not valid, determined by the presence of certain specific values. Instead, 
if that is the case,  it now copies the default configuration (see Figure 7 in the documentation) for the USB mode only as a default. Enabling the WiFi mode now requires 
the insertion of the jumper to enter the configuration state.
