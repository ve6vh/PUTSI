This directory contains a modified version of app_rpt for Allstar V2.0.0. Beta 6 which has additional
printf statements for PUTSI debugging. You need the full source code to be able to compile it, 
which can be downloaded from the Allstarlink site.
This code has only been tested on the V2 platform, there is no guarantee that it will even compile
correctly on the older code.
