PUTSI is an acronym for PIC USB Telecommunications System Interface, a telemetry gathering device for up to 8
analog inputs, 6 digital inputs and 5 digital outputs.

It interfaces directly with Allstar, to replace the previous Chameleon device, and is 100% compatible. Alarms
and telemetry can be set up using the methods in Allstar.

In addition, it has a WiFi mode that uses the USRP UDP IP protocol to send telemetry packets to a remote system.
A wifi connection can be established using a router such as a MicroTik HAP or simular device. Configuration is
accomplished using a host mode and web browser on a PC, tablet or phone. Montoring software is
provided by the Alberta Digital Radio Communications Society (ADRCS).

The device can be used in either mode, or both. Bidirecitonal packet exchanges ensure that the digital outputs can 
be toggled remotely.
